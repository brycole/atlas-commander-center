System for atlas automation




## Importan! WIP
It is a project under development, the code is not optimized due to the amount of testing I had to do to achieve this result.

## Installation

npm install @solana/web3.js

npm i cli-table

## Config `userConfig.ts`

`userConfig.ts:` It is necessary that you add all the addresses of your ships and their tanks. To facilitate this task you should do the actions with the Sage web site, and look at the details of the sign in https://explorer.solana.com/. 

The planets and their resources are configured for 'USTUR'. If this is your section there are addresses that you should not modify, as they will be correct.

You must also add your 'privateKey' in the correct format in the file  `userConfig.ts`
